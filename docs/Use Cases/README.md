# Use Cases

This document tracks all use cases for the SimRacingFFB application. Use the checkboxes to track progress.

## Use Case Status

- [ ] [Driver feels resistance when turning into a corner](./Driver%20feels%20resistance%20when%20turning%20into%20a%20corner/Behaviors.md)

---

## How to Use This File

1. **Add a new use case**: Create a folder under `docs/Use Cases/` with the use case name, then add a checkbox entry here linking to its `Behaviors.md` file
2. **Mark as complete**: Check the box `[x]` when the use case is fully implemented and tested
3. **Track progress**: You can also add status indicators:
   - `[ ]` - Not started
   - `[~]` - In progress (you can use `[ ]` and add a note, or create custom status)
   - `[x]` - Complete

## Use Case Template

When creating a new use case:
1. Create folder: `docs/Use Cases/{UseCaseName}/`
2. Create file: `docs/Use Cases/{UseCaseName}/Behaviors.md`
3. Add entry to this file with checkbox

---

## Notes

- Each use case folder contains a `Behaviors.md` file with the behaviors for that use case
- Use cases are narrow vertical slices of functionality
- Work on one use case at a time
- See [Workflow.md](../Workflow.md) for the complete development workflow
