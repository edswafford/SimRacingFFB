# What actually causes “resistance” in a real car?

From vehicle dynamics and real steering systems:

The dominant contributor is self-aligning torque (SAT) generated by tire forces.

Key contributors:

- Lateral tire force (primary contributor)
- Steering angle (input)
 - Vehicle speed (scales force)
- Load on front tires (implicit via lateral force)
- Direction of motion (sign of torque)
